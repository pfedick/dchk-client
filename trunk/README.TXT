Domain Check (DCHK)
===================

DCHK stands for DomainavailabilityChecK and is a new protocol to check the
availability of domains. It is based on IRIS, the Internet Registry
Information Service (see RFC 3981) and is defined in RFC 5144: A Domain
Availability Check (DCHK) Registry Type for the Internet. It uses the
Lightweight UDP Transfer Protocol for the Internet Registry Information
Service, defined in RFC 4993 for transport.

This software contains a library, a command line interface (CLI) and
a graphical user interface (GUI), written in C and C++, which you can
use to query domains.

You can find more information about DCHK, it's installation, usage and
API description in the sub directory "documentation/html" or online at
