/*!\page DCHK_history History

Version 0.5.8
  - Decompression-Buffer is dynamicaly increased 5 times when the
    initially calculated space is not big enough.
  - Moved sourcecode to SVN

Version 0.5.7, Release date: 04.08.2010		(CVS-Tag: REL_0_5_7)
  - Removed -lstdc++ from LIBS in Makefile. The CLI is plain C, so we
    don't need it. On Solaris it didn't even compile with this switch.
  - fixed a segmentation fault in xmlparser.c which occured when there
    is no lastDatabaseUpdateDateTime value or no status node in the
    answer section.

Version 0.5.6, Release date: 16.07.2009		(CVS-Tag: REL_0_5_6)
  - Added some checks in configure for existing ns_msg_getflag, ns_skiprr,
    ns_initparse and ns_parserr (library now compiles on Ubuntu 9.04)
  - changed some parameters from "char *" in "const char*"
  - changed some pointers to references in the C++ classes
  - fixed some documentation errors
  
Version 0.5.5, Release date: 29.04.2009		(CVS-Tag: REL_0_5_5)
  - Fixed an error in irislwz_Query2, which was introduced in
    Version 0.5.4. A terminating Null-Byte got lost.

Version 0.5.4, Release date: 12.03.2009		(CVS-Tag: REL_0_5_4)
  - Lib: New function irislwz_Query2, which takes a third parameter
    indicating the size of the payload
  - Lib: Bugfix in irislwz_Query2/irislwz_Query: after copying the
    payload into the internal buffer, it was not checked if the memory
    was allocated successfully.
  - Lib: Special characters in domain names, which are not allowed in
    XML, get escaped now. These characters are: &, ", ', < and >
    The new function dchk_EscapeSpecialChars is uesed for this.
  - CLI: New parameter "-f". With this you can use the contents of a
    file as input for the query. This must be a valid DCHK-XML request,
    but for testing purpose this could be everything, including a
    binary. The input is not checked for valid XML by the client. Nice
    for testing a DCHK server :-)
  - Removed RFC1950 option from GUI. Library and CLI still support it

Version 0.5.3, Release date: 01.12.2008		(CVS-Tag: REL_0_5_3)
  - Changed compression. Packets were compressed with zlib wrapper as
    described in RFC 1950. But the IRISLWZ RFC 4993 specifies to use
    RFC 1951, which is the raw deflated datastream without any header.
    This is a bug not only in this client, but also in DENIC's DCHK server
    and java client, which will be fixed soon.
  - CLI: new parameter "--rfc1950" to use the zlib-wrapper in compression
    as it was done before. The new default is now to use the raw deflated
    datastream without zlib-wrapper.
  - Lib: new function "irislwz_UseRFC1950", to tell the library to use the
    zlib-wrapper, as it was done before. The new default is now to use the
    raw datastream without zlib-wrapper.
  - GUI: added a new checkbox to switch between wrong RFC 1950 and
    correct RFC 1951 compression implementation.
  - Constructor of CDchk initialise the class to send uncompressed
    requests
  - Fixed a memory leak in irislwz_Talk
  - Enhanced dchk.m4 autoconf macro

Version 0.5.2, Release date: 23.11.2008		(CVS-Tag: REL_0_5_2)
  - Fixed a bug in the XML parser
  - Fixed some typos in the configure script
  - Added new functions for testing purposes. The functions can
    be used to manipulate the request packet before it gets send
    to a server. Use them to test a server's behavior of corrupt
    data.
       - irislwz_TestSetVersion
       - irislwz_TestSetTransactionId
       - irislwz_TestSetHeader
       - irislwz_TestTruncatePacket
       - irislwz_TestSetAuthorityLength
       - irislwz_TestCorruptCompression
       - irislwz_TestCleanup
  - A response with transactionId 0xffff is not treated as error
    anymore 
  - Fixed a wrong path in Doxygen configuration file
  - CLI: renamed flag --ac back to --dac. The rename in the last
    version was completely stupid, and in fact the CLI interpreted
    the flag as to not send compressed requests...
  
Version 0.5.1, Release date: 21.11.2008		(CVS-Tag: REL_0_5_1)
  - CLI: Changed default for using compression. The new default is now
    to send uncompressed requests.
  - CLI: Flag --dac renamed in --ac, flag --dsc replaced by --sc
  - GUI: Changed default for using compression. The new default is
    to send uncompressed requests.
  - Restructured directory structure in CVS
  - Updated Documentation for new doxygen version 1.5.7.1

Version 0.5.0, Release date: 10.10.2008		(CVS-Tag: REL_0_5_0)
  - First public release
